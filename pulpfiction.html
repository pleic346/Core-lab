They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses - nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.</p>

      <p>It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's  feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.Foot massages don't mean shit.</p>
