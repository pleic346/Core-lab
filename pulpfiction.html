They had this garden<br> at the bottom, enclosed in <br> glass, like one of them <br>greenhouses - nigger fell <br>through that. Since then, he's <br>kinda developed a speech<br> impediment.</p></div>

      <p>JULES - It ain't no ballpark either.<br> Look maybe your method of massage <br>differs from mine, but touchin' his <br>lady's  feet, and stickin' your tongue <br>in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the<br> same ballpark, ain't the same league,<br> ain't even the same fuckin' sport.<br>Foot massages don't mean shit.</p>
