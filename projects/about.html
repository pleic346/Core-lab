            <h1><strong> STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</strong><br></h1><h2>The purpose of this website is for it to be an informative yet interactive platform in which you can learn about the different piers that surround New York;  its many views, charming restaurants, and hang out places. The main goal being for the viewer to experience a ‘run’ through the pier.</h2> 
            <h1><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong><br></h1><h2>The intended audience for the websites are runners! Locals who run at the piers daily and want to know more about the places they can stop at and discover. It is also meant for tourists who want to walk along the edge of New York enjoying the jaw-dropping view of the skyline meeting the river. Furthermore, the website can also be navigated by locals who have never been to the pier and decide to take a walk away from the busy streets. </h2>
            <h1><strong>WIRE FRAME</strong><br><h2> DESKTOP HD <br> -When you first go into the website you wil be greeted with a video of the pier; it would be filmed in the perspective of a person running. (The camera will be shaking and you would hear their heavy breathing).(you are the eyes of the runner) Goal= for this to be a running experience through the piers.<br> -When you pause or step out of the video and scroll down, as you navigate the website, there will be a record playing of  birds chirping, water dropping, the wind, the boats, and footsteps. (On the top right of the website you will be able to control the sound).<br>-As you scroll down, you get the name of the stops/places, pictures, and background information on it. You can click into the specific site to see it in a map, an also to read more about it and watch more videos and pictures of it. <br>

                -It will be pretty similar to the DESKTOP, however, on the right side of the video you will get different screens in which you can click into and see different angles of the video. For example, you can see the runners face, back view, top view, etc. It will be as if you have a drone and are taking a look all around the runner. <br>
